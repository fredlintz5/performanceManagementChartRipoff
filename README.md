# Performance Management Chart Ripoff
My own personal PMC, modeled off of [Training Peaks Software](https://www.trainingpeaks.com/blog/what-is-the-performance-management-chart/). I do personally have a paid Training Peaks account, that provides this same exact information, allowing an athlete to track their Training Stress Score, along with Chronic and Acute Training loads over time, and into the future. 

Training Peaks' software is way more advanced and much easier to use, but I wanted to see if I could build the same logic myself. 

Using charts.js, moment.js, Google Auth Login, and Google Firebase for Data Storgae, I've created a basic application that would allow a user to input their Training Stress Score, and track their fitness over time and even project their fitness by adding workouts in the future.
