convert .fit to csv
- ```fredlintz@Freds-MBP FitSDKRelease_21.60.00 % java -jar java/FitCSVTool.jar java/fredTest2.fit```



TODOS:

BACKEND
  need to run csvFileToJson on a file with multiple laps (to see/understand how laps are recorded)
  - Add workout_data object per lap

  architect 'workout' storage in Firebase
    - method of insert and shape of object to be stored
    - must allow multiple workouts per day, per user
    - maybe have a 'workout_slim' (without second by second data)?
    - maybe have a 'workout_detailed' (with second by second data)?

  - heart_rate && power zones
    - time spent in zones charts

  - Variability Index


FRONTEND
  - User Settings
    - metric vs imperial
    - celsius vs fahrenheit
    - set FTP
    - set HR zones
    - set Power zones

  - Upload Workouts
  - Dashboard View
  - Calendar View
  - Workout View
  - Planned Workouts

  - Specificity Tags? (Future nice to have) - allow user to tag workout with different tags to highlight the type of workout
    - Threshold, LSD, Anaerobic, Tabata, Sprints, etc
    - On dashboards (PMC) user could toggle tags, and see the types of workouts over time/leading up to events (was I training specific to my intended disciplne?)
