TODOS:

BACKEND
  store every second of lap data
    - use lat/long to draw maps
    - use altitude/gain to draw chart of route altitudes
    - use power, cadence, HR, temp points to plot data to graphs, etc
  architect 'workout' storage in Firebase
    - method of insert and shape of object to be stored
    - must allow multiple workouts per day, per user
    - maybe have a 'workout_slim' (without second by second data)?
    - maybe have a 'workout_detailed' (with second by second data)?

  - heart_rate && power zones
    - time spent in zones charts

  - Variability Index


FRONTEND
  - User Settings
    - metric vs imperial
    - celsius vs fahrenheit
    - set FTP
    - set HR zones
    - set Power zones

  - Upload Workouts
  - Dashboard View
  - Calendar View
  - Workout View
  - Planned Workouts

  - Specificity Tags? (Future nice to have) - allow user to tag workout with different tags to highlight the type of workout
    - Threshold, LSD, Anaerobic, Tabata, Sprints, etc
    - On dashboards (PMC) user could toggle tags, and see the types of workouts over time/leading up to events (was I training specific to my intended disciplne?)
